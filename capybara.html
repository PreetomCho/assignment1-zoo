            The Capybara is the largest living rodent native to South America. 
            They are herbivores often eating grass, grains, melons, squash, etc. 
            An adult capybara can eat 6 to 8 pounds of grass a day. The average
            lifespan of a Capybara is 8 to 10 years. Capybaras are often seen 
            around bodies of water to help cool them off or escape from predators.
