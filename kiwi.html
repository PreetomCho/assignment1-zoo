            The Kiwi is a type of flightless bird native to New Zealand.
            They are omnivores, mostly eating worms, but also other insects,
            berries, and seeds. The average lifespan of a Kiwi is long, with 50
            years in the wild, but 30 years in captivity. They typically live in
            forest areas with shrubs and bushes, as they don't have the wings to
            fly up to trees. Instead, the kiwi dig burrows as their nesting spot.
