            The Koala is a herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
            They consume around 500 grams of leaves a day, getting 50% of
            their water via the leaves as well. The average lifespan of a 
            Koala is 13-18 years. They typically live in tall eucalpyt forests
            and low eucalypt woodlands. In order for the babies to eat the
            eucalyptus leaves, the koala mother gives her fecal matter to the
            baby to get the bacteria to dissolve the toxins.
