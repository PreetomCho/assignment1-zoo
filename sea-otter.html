            The Sea Otter is a marine mammal native to northern and eastern Pacific Ocean. They often eat
            invertebrates like crabs and mussels, as well as fish. The average lifespan of
            a sea otter varies on male or female, with 10-15 years for a male, and 15-20 for
            female. They live in coastal waters, typically close to shore. Sea otters have dense fur,
            but not a lot of bodyfat, making them cold easier. To avoid this, sea otters cuddle with each other
            to share body heat.
